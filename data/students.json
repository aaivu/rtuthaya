As part of a group project, I am contributing to a multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) initiative focused on developing a universal model capable of recognizing speech emotions across 15+ languages. Our team has released EmoTa, a Tamil SER dataset capturing the nuances of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects, addressing resource gaps for Dravidian languages. Using technologies like Python, PyTorch, Transformers, and CNNs, we aim to advance inclusive and multilingual AI systems.",

                        I was born in Jaffna, a city which had to, directly and quite incessantly, confront the effects
                        of the civil war that had ravaged the island for more than three decades. Despite my childhood
                        having been such a rough patch, in retrospect it had always been memorable and surprisingly
                        cheerful. Akin to the silver lining in each cloud, growing in such rough conditions made me
                        focus more on my education. My parents insisted the importance of learning despite the
                        shortcomings I was protractedly bound to deal with. Till my teenage years, I even had to study
                        under the faint light scattered by oil lamps. However, I enjoyed learning despite all the
                        hardships. I took an eminent liking to mathematics and Tamil language. During this time, my dad
                        used to regularly share with us his work experience as a government medical officer operating
                        all around the island. He never failed to point out to us, that we are surrounded by good people
                        and how such people have been of immense help both in his personal and professional life. Thus
                        far, these stories have had a great influence on me and now I share some of these stories with
                        my son.

                        In the late nineties (1998) our family moved to Colombo. I joined Hindu College Colombo (HCC)
                        while I was reading grade 10. Teachers at HCC spotted various talents in me and molded me into a
                        leader. Within just a year at my new school, I was actively involved in drama, debates and
                        hockey. Specifically, I performed extremely well in debates and won roughly 32 champion trophies
                        during my time at school. I was appointed as the head prefect of the college which gave me a
                        lifetime of memorable experience in leading 32 smart young men for the betterment of our school.
                        The year I headed the prefect's guild also happened to be the golden jubilee year of the
                        college, owing to which we were granted with the opportunity of organizing jubilee walk, jubilee
                        exhibition and jubilee grand cultural day in addition to regular school functions such as prize
                        giving, sports meet, teacher's day, etc. The task of organizing these events consumed
                        significant time. Hence my teachers and well-wishers constantly reminded me the importance of
                        advanced level examinations that were round the corner. With their guidance and the support from
                        some of my close friends, I was able to manage both my studies and extra curricular activities
                        and achieve good grades in advanced level examinations adequate to confer on me an admission to
                        the University of Moratuwa with merits.

                        My 4 years at Moratuwa, learning electronics and telecommunication engineering was very
                        different from my time at high school. This was mainly due to the self-learning required in an
                        university environment was relatively higher than that required for high schools. Fortunately
                        for me, 3 of my very good friends from school ended up with me in the same degree program.
                        During this time not only our friendship strengthened, but it also helped me remarkably in my
                        academic activities as well. As a result of this, three of us graduated with first class and one
                        with second upper. Though it was undeniably enjoyable and memorable, I wouldn't say that this
                        was equally enjoyable as my school days. I felt that my undergraduate studies pressurized me
                        more than what was generally called for. As a result of this, I wanted to create a more
                        conducive environment for my students. I tried to reduce the unwanted stress caused in an
                        undergraduate course by improving clarity and providing necessary resources. Though I studied
                        electronics and telecommunications as my major, I have always enjoyed computer engineering
                        subjects. Hence, I ended up assuming a computer science and engineering career later.

                        Right after my graduation, I was hired as a software engineer at Millennium Information
                        Technology limited, one of the leading software companies at that time. I was able to impress my
                        team leaders with my expeditiously problem-solving skills. I realized the importance of the
                        extracurricular activities I had done during school time. The skills I had developed due to the
                        extracurricular activities enabled me to distinguish myself from the other engineers promptly.
                        This helped me grow in my career relatively faster.

                        One year later, I joined a research engineering team which worked on "information retrieval"
                        products. This team was composed of several doctoral degree holders. I cherished the mentorship
                        I obtained during this time from the senior engineers with doctoral degrees. They were humble,
                        yet smart. The manner in which they explained concepts and phenomena were remarkable. The
                        solutions they came up with were simple but effective. I was tremendously inspired by them. This
                        led me to pursue a doctoral degree with the aspiration that doing so will assist me achieve such

                        I applied to several north American universities to follow a doctoral program in computer
                        science. I was offered an opportunity to pursue a doctoral degree in computer science at
                        University of Georgia USA. I was also provided a scholarship along with the admission. I was
                        lucky to have had Prof. Prashant Doshi, a great researcher, as my supervisor. He showed me the
                        manner to analyze computer science problems, which was entirely different to the previous
                        approaches I adopted. The time I spent as a doctoral student under his supervision enabled me to
                        take up the challenging engineering and scientific problems in the field of semantic computing.
                        During this tenor I published three research papers in an esteemed American Artificial
                        Intelligence conference and a journal in a highly respected Journal of Artificial Intelligence.
                        He bestowed on me several opportunities to co teach his subjects and co review some conferences
                        for which he served as a member of the program committee. This paved my path to become a
                        stronger researcher in the field of artificial intelligence. During this time, I interned at
                        Google and Accenture Tech Labs, some of the leading artificial intelligence tech companies in
                        the world. I was awarded both outstanding graduate student of the year and graduate student
                        fellowship. One of my most cherished memories during my tenure at Google is the time I spent
                        with Prof. Peter Norvig, head of Google research, who is also known as the father of modern AI.

                        I worked in various companies which allowed me to gain profuse experience in technology and
                        ability to manage researchers. I was able to evolve into a senior manager within the first
                        couple of years of my career. I further gained ample experience in cutting edge technologies in
                        fields of Big Data, Data Science and Machine Learning. This proved to be of profound value for
                        my teaching since I generally associate my personal experience with teaching.

                        I was always passionate about coming back to Sri Lanka and serving the country. Late Mr. Lalith
                        Athulathmudali is a great inspiration for me. I was awarded the Mahapola scholarship which was
                        founded by Late Mr. Lalith Athulathmudali. This instilled in me the concept of "Giving Back to
                        the country". Even before I went to the USA I was interested in coming back to Sri Lanka to
                        settle down. I may not have owned the dream of becoming an academic. However, with time I
                        realized my passion for teaching and working in the field of computer science and engineering as
                        a researcher. The skills I developed as a researcher and the hands-on experience I gained during
                        my industrial encounter in the USA fuelled me to perform as a lecturer. I thoroughly enjoy my
                        time as a lecturer at the university I studied.
